A paragraph is a group of sentences that discusses a specific idea or point in writing. Paragraphs are a conventional way to organize longer pieces of writing, though they aren't required by the orthographic conventions of any language. 
Here are some tips for writing paragraphs: 
Length: Writing experts recommend paragraphs that are no longer than 250 words and contain three to eight sentences. 
Indentation: Paragraphs can start with a five-space indentation or by skipping a line and then starting over. 
Topic sentence: The topic sentence of a paragraph informs the reader about the paragraph's topic. 
Varying lengths: Varying the lengths of paragraphs can make writing more interesting.
